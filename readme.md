## Why
I was growing tired of the SR Play app on android since it had a bunch of bugs that really bugged me, so I decided to make my own version. The Swedish National Radio has a completely open API which allowed me to make this app. This is a remake and improvement of [SR-Play-For-Me](https://github.com/viggoStrom/SR-Play-For-Me).
